# Rewarding Healthy Habits: Building a Smart Incentive System for Health Insurance

Picture this: You're a health insurance company that wants to revolutionize how you engage with your customers. Instead of just collecting premiums and paying claims, you want to **actively encourage healthy behaviors** and reward your most consistent users with meaningful benefits.

## 🏃‍♂️ The Challenge: Motivating Consistent Health Habits

Meet **HealthGuard Insurance**, a forward-thinking company that decided to take a proactive approach to customer wellness. They recognized that healthy customers are not just happier—they're also less likely to file expensive claims.

**The Big Idea**: Provide a **10% discount on insurance premiums** to users who maintain **comprehensive healthy habits** throughout the week.

But here's the million-dollar question: **How do you accurately track and reward consistent users without creating a system that's either too complex or easily gamed?**

## 🎯 The Business Goal

HealthGuard's wellness app tracks various user activities:

- 📱 **Step count** throughout the day
- ❤️ **Heart rate** monitoring
- 🍎 **Calorie intake** tracking
- 🏃‍♀️ **Exercise sessions** and duration

The challenge? Building a system that can:

- **Accurately track** multiple health metrics weekly
- **Automatically identify** consistently healthy users
- **Instantly apply** premium discounts
- **Scale effortlessly** as the user base grows

## 🛠️ The Technical Solution: Real-Time Health Metrics Tracking

### Step 1: Continuous Data Collection

The app needs to track multiple health metrics continuously and send this data to Datablit for processing. Here's how it works:

**The Approach:**

1. **Internal counting**: The app track metrics internally every minute
2. **Smart tracking**: Only send data when a metrics is > 0 to avoid unnecessary API calls
3. **Real-time updates**: Use Datablit's track function for immediate data processing

```js
// Example1: Tracking health metrics every minute
datablit.track("RECORD_HEALTH_METRICS", {
  time: "2025-10-13:22:11:00",
  step_count: 44,
  calorie_intake: 0,
  exercise_duration: 1,
});

// Example2
datablit.track("RECORD_HEALTH_METRICS", {
  time: "2025-10-13:22:11:00",
  step_count: 0,
  calorie_intake: 50,
  exercise_duration: 0,
});
```

### Step 2: Building the Weekly Health Metrics

Now comes the magic—converting individual health metrics into meaningful weekly aggregates:

**📊 Signal: Weekly Health Metrics**

<BlogImage src="/users_1w.png" alt="Weekly health metrics aggregation" width={600} />

This signal automatically:

- 🔄 **Aggregates** all health metrics from the past 7 days
- ⚡ **Updates in real-time** as new data is recorded
- 📈 **Maintains accuracy** with high-frequency data collection

## 🎯 The Smart Rule: Identifying Consistently Healthy Users

With our weekly health metrics in place, we can now create an intelligent rule that automatically identifies users who deserve the premium discount:

**🚨 Rule: Consistent User Detection**

```
user_1w_step_count > 70000 && user_1w_calorie_intake > 10000 && user_1w_exercise_duration > 60
```

<BlogImage
  src="/consistent_user_rule.png"
  alt="checks if user is consistent or not"
  width={500}
/>

**The Logic**: Users qualify for the 10% premium discount when they meet ALL three criteria:

- **Steps**: More than 70,000 steps per week
- **Nutrition**: More than 10,000 calories consumed per week
- **Exercise**: More than 60 minutes of exercise per week

This comprehensive approach ensures that users are maintaining a truly healthy lifestyle across multiple dimensions, not just being active.

## 🚀 The Implementation: Real-Time Decision Making

When it's time to process premium payments, the application can instantly evaluate whether a user qualifies for the discount:

```js
// Check if user qualifies for premium discount
const isConsistentUser = datablit.evalRule("consistent_user_rule", "user_1");

if (isConsistentUser) {
  // Apply 10% discount to premium
  applyPremiumDiscount(userId, 0.1);
} else {
  // Process standard premium
  processStandardPremium(userId);
}
```

## 🎉 The Results: A Win-Win Solution

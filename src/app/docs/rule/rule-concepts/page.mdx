## Key Concepts

Creating and managing rules can be time consuming.
What if you could do it all yourself in just a few clicks?

Introducing Rules in DataBlit — the fastest way to respond to user behavior and trigger action in real time.

So what exactly is a rule?

Rule is a condition or pattern you define using signals and logical expression. It watches incoming data, user behaviour, signals or system events. Once it’s triggered, it can kick off an immediate action and response to changing user behaviour. You can fetch the outcome instantly using the Rule Evaluate Api in your codebase.
Think of it like smart assistants that help your product make real time decisions.

1. Rule is created combining logical expressions and signals.
2. Evaluates at runtime using an API call
3. It returns boolean (either true or false)

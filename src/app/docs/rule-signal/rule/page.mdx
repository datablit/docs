# Rule

Creating and managing rules can be time consuming. What if you could do it all yourself in just a few clicks?
Datablit Rule is the fastest way to respond to user behavior and trigger conditional action in real time.

So what exactly is a rule?

Rule is a condition or pattern you define using [signals](/docs/rule-signal/signal) 
and [logical expression](/docs/rule-signal/logical-expression). 
eg.
```Go
orders_24h > 20 && order_amount_6h < 600
``` 

Here orders_24h and order_amount_6h are realtime signals

It compute these conditions on runtime. You can fetch the outcome instantly using 
the Rule Evaluate API or Datablit SDK methods in your codebase.  

Think of it like smart assistants that help your product make real time decisions.

1. Rule is created combining logical expressions and signals.
2. Evaluates at runtime using an API call
3. It returns boolean (either true or false)

# Event Ingestion with Datablit

This doc will guide you how to ingest customer data from source to Datablit.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create Datablit Account

Signup and get access to the [Datablit Console](https://console.datablit.com)

### 2. Create or Select an Existing Project

A project is basically a core product or platform developed and managed by a company as a distinct business operational unit.
eg. if you have an online delivery company where user can place order from website, android and ios app, you need one project and 3 sources.

Note: We recommend to create an extra project for testing eg. staging-project

### 3. Setup Event Sources

Click on + Source button, select source type and write a meaningful name then click on create.

We recommend creating separate sources for different applications:

#### Source Configuration Examples
<Table
  columns={[
    { header: "Source type"},
    { header: "Source Name"}
  ]}
  data={[
    ["kotlin", "kotlin app"],
    ["swift", "ios app"],
    ["javascript", "next-js website"],
    ["facebook_lead_ads", "facebook ads"],
    ["http_api", "python server"],
  ]}
/>

### 4. Copy API Key or Webook URL

Once the source is created, you will get the **_API Key_**  or **_Webhook URL_** in the source table. 
API key is essential for authenticating your SDK. We recommend keeping your api key secure and never 
expose it publicly. Webhook URL is needed to integrate third party tools eg, facebook lead ads

### 5. Integrate Datablit Source

Now you can collect customer data by implementing Datablit’s tracking SDK as your Source. 
Install SDK and create separate sources for different applications.
Datablit SDK will track customer events and upload them in batches after every 30 second. 
This limits the number of network calls made and helps you to access data in real-time.
Check source wise details [here](/docs/datablit-sources).

### 6. Test your SDK Integration

Send test events to verify the feasibility of your code and sdk integration. 
You can test API calls immediately and test events will appear in your dashboard as real data.
Run following query in **Data** tab.

```sql
select * from events order by timestamp desc;
```

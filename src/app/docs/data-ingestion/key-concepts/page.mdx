### Key Concepts

**_DataBlit_** is event centric and optimised for very large sets of data, this means that every action end users take in your source is tracked as an event. An event is a data point that represents an interaction between a user and your product. It can contain any number of custom dimensions, interactions or properties that you can set to track.

Event ingestion is the process of collecting and sending customer events from applications (Android, iOS, or web) to DataBlit.

## Prerequisites-

## Datablit SDK

In a nutshell, Datablit SDK tracks customer interaction about whatâ€™s happening in your site or app, transforms them and sends them to Datablit warehouse in real-time. Now you can use the data as per your business needs in different ways to deliver customer experience. Monitor performance, create uniquely customised user experience, launch campaigns, take business action, or develop long term strategy.

## Source

A data source is any system, mobile apps, cloud apps, website or third party tools from which event data is collected, it represents the origin of customer data.

# Create New Experiment

To create a new Experiment, open the Experiment Tab in the Event section.

## Overview

Experiment allows you to test different versions of feature, content, or user experience to determine what performs better. Datablit experiment platform provides:

- **Variant Management**: Create and manage multiple experiment variants
- **Traffic Allocation**: Control what percentage of users see each variant
- **Real-time Results**: Monitor experiment performance in real-time
- **Statistical Significance**: Built-in statistical analysis for reliable results

## Creating an Experiment

Follow these steps to create and configure your first experiment:

### Step 1: Navigate to Experiments

1. Go to the **Experiments** tab in the [Datablit Console](https://console.datablit.com)
2. Click on **+ Experiment** to create a new experiment

### Step 2: Basic Configuration

Provide the following information for your experiment:

{" "}

<Table
  columns={[
    { header: "PROPERTY", width: "20%" },
    { header: "TYPE", width: "15%" },
    { header: "REQUIRED", width: "10%" },
    { header: "DESCRIPTION", width: "50%" },
  ]}
  data={[
    [
      "Experiment name",
      "String",
      "Yes",
      "A string to understand the experiment purpose",
    ],
    ["Description", "String", "Yes", "Description of the experiment"],
    [
      "Tags",
      "Dropdown",
      "No",
      <>
        Tags to categorize experiments. You can manage tags in the{" "}
        <a
          href={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_DATABLIT_CONSOLE_URL}
          className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline"
        >
          company profile section
        </a>
      </>,
    ],
  ]}
/>

Click **Create** to save your experiment

### Step 3: Advanced Configuration

Experiment will get added on experiment list after its created. Click on the experiment to access the details page to configure advance settings:

<Table
  columns={[
    { header: "PROPERTY", width: "20%" },
    { header: "TYPE", width: "15%" },
    { header: "REQUIRED", width: "10%" },
    { header: "DESCRIPTION", width: "50%" },
  ]}
  data={[
    [
      "Status",
      "Dropdown",
      "Yes",
      <>
        By default, the status is set to Active. To disable the experiment,
        change the status to Disabled. Once disabled, all entities will receive
        the <b>control</b> variant.
      </>,
    ],
    [
      "Percentage",
      "Number",
      "Yes",
      <>
        Specify the percentage of entities (e.g., users, devices, etc.) for
        which the experiment should be enabled. For example, if the percentage
        is set to 10, the experiment will return a test variant for 10% of the
        entities. The remaining 90% will receive the <b>control</b> variant.
      </>,
    ],
    [
      "Variants",
      "Popup",
      "Yes",
      <>
        Click "Create Variant" to add a new variant. To create a variant,
        provide a unique name (note: 'control' is reserved and cannot be used)
        and assign a percentage value to it.
      </>,
    ],
    [
      "Static Allotment",
      "Dropdown",
      "No",
      <>
        To assign a specific test entity ID to a particular variant, enter the
        ID, choose the desired variant, and click "Assign." This ensures that
        the specified ID consistently receives the selected variant, regardless
        of the experiment’s configuration or rollout percentage.
      </>,
    ],
  ]}
/>

## Understanding Experiment Assignment

Traffic allocation in Datablit experiments works on a two-level system:

### Example Configuration

Let's consider an experiment with the following setup:

- **Overall Percentage**: 20% of total users
- **Variants**:
  - `v1` (60% of experiment traffic)
  - `v2` (40% of experiment traffic)

### Traffic Distribution

- **20% of users** participate in the experiment
  - 60% of these users (12% of total) receive variant `v1`
  - 40% of these users (8% of total) receive variant `v2`
- **80% of users** receive the **control** variant (no experiment)

## Retrieving Experiment Variants

To determine which variant a user should see, you can retrieve the experiment assignment using either the Datablit SDK or direct API calls.

### Method 1: Using Datablit SDK

The recommended approach is to use the Datablit SDK for your platform. Check out the [Datablit Sources documentation](/docs/datablit-sources) and navigate to your platform's specific implementation.

### Method 2: Direct API Call

```sh
curl --location 'https://api.datablit.com/api/1.0/experiment/variant?expId=01JVJT9CPXGEJVC7TDSX538Y8F&entityId=1321' \
--header 'apiKey: 01JSWDEZYM0E19ZF3RMHS75PB1'
```

**API Response**

The API returns the assigned variant for the specified entity:

```json
{
  "expId": "01JVJT9CPXGEJVC7TDSX538Y8F",
  "entityId": "1321",
  "variant": "control"
}
```

**Finding Your Experiment ID**

You can find your experiment ID from the Datablit Console:

1. Navigate to your experiment details page
2. Copy Id

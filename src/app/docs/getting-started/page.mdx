## What is Datablit

Datablit is a Customer Data and Intelligence Platform, which simplifies the process of collecting events and its associated properties from the users allowing you to create instant rule based actions and in-depth analysis for long term strategic business decisions eliminating the need to worry about managing expensive data pipelines and ensuring its good health.

## React Faster with Instant Rule Based Actions and Key Metrics

Imagine you coming up with a creative business strategy, and executing this could take weeks or months. By the time you execute, the peak moment has likely passed. Also managing and deploying various data pipelines for a diverse set of conditions can cost time and cost.

With Datablit Rule and Signals, you can do all within minutes and get instant results without the need to write code and manage data pipelines.

## Plan Smarter with in-depth Analysis

Datablit enables high-performance analytics with SQL and easy to select options on large datasets for long term business decisions. It helps you to unlock insights, understand your customers better and answer questions about your product with an interactive dashboard in just a few clicks.

## Optimize ROI with Experiment

Sticking out with traditional methods and what’s working currently means missed opportunity to what might work even better with changing customer preferences. Exploration of new options and identifying one which provides maximum ROI is key for business success.
Datablit allows you to experiment with multiple variants at once, observe outcomes, learn and gradually refine it to drive business results.

# Getting Started with Data Signals

Data Signals are custom metrics that you can use to trigger actions based on user behavior and events. Examples include:

- Number of orders in the last 24 hours
- Average order value per customer
- Number of orders cancelled in the last 12 hours

A signal is identified by its unique key and is stored at the user level. To evaluate a signal, you need both a user ID and signal key.

## Basic Terminology

### Aggregation Window

An aggregation window defines the time period over which metrics are calculated. For example, if you want to count the number of orders in the last 24 hours, the aggregation window is 24 hours.

### Freshness

Freshness represents the maximum time difference between when an event occurs and when the metrics are recorded. It indicates how current your metrics data is.

**Example:** A user opens an app at 8:30, 8:40, 9:00, 9:10, 9:30, etc. If you want to compute the total number of sessions in the last hour and evaluate this every hour (at 8:00, 9:00, etc.), the metrics freshness would be 1 hour. This means the computed session count will be at most 1 hour old.

Freshness and aggregation window are logically related. Generally, larger aggregation windows can tolerate lower freshness, while smaller windows require higher freshness. For example:

- Order count over the last 10 years can have 24-hour or 12-hour freshness
- Order count over the last 30 minutes requires real-time freshness (< 1 minute)

## Signal Types

Based on aggregation window and freshness requirements, there are two types of signals:

### 1. Realtime Signal

Use realtime signals when you need high freshness (< 1 minute). These are ideal for scenarios requiring immediate data updates.

**Example:** Number of sessions in the last hour

### 2. Batch Signal

Use batch signals when you need aggregation over longer periods and can tolerate a few hours of freshness.

**Example:** Number of orders in the last 10 years with 12-hour freshness

## Realtime Aggregation Types

Realtime signals support three types of aggregation:

- **Static:** Extract a specific field (Field Name) from the event (e.g., `os_name`)
- **Count:** Count the number of events (e.g., number of orders)
- **Sum:** Sum a specific field (Field Name) from events (e.g., total order value by adding the `order_amount` field of each event)

## Evaluate Signal

To evaluate a signal, click on the three dots in the signal list and select "Evaluate."
Next, enter the user_id and submit. This will return the signal value for the specified user.

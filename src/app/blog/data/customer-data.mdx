## How to Ensure that Customers Keep Coming Back to You

In today’s digital economy, businesses don’t just compete on product or price — they compete on how fast and reliable they are. Building trust and satisfying customers means real-time personalised action and great customer experience.
While change is inevitable, success of business lies in how rapidly we adapt and respond.

To build a differentiated experience the first step is understanding your customer. Customer understanding is built on data. So, how data is collected, how it's activated, and how quickly it can respond and take action to customer behavior is a matter of business success and failure.

Yet too often, companies anchor their data around tools like the data warehouse or CRM, not the customer themselves.

Many business leaders consider this as a tech problem but this is a business problem. The question you should ask yourself- Does your organization currently have Frankenstack?

Here are some signs to identify Frankenstack monster killing growth and putting unnecessary risk to your business:

- Adding software to meet immediate needs without considering the bigger picture.

- Category leaders relying on integration for core functionality, forcing you to buy multiple tools. Warehouses are optimized for storage, querying, and analytics—not real-time action. CRMs are built for sales and marketing
  workflows—not for unifying first-party data across product, support, and engineering.

- You are using a bunch of tools that don’t talk to each other and require extensive technical resources to orchestrate, clean, and govern customer data at scale before it becomes usable for other teams.

- Figuring out total tech cost is an uphill battle, takes time and effort to manage multiple tools.

The result - **A disjoint experience with wrangling messy data and jumping between platforms.**

**1. Missed Opportunities for Real-Time Engagement-** Most organisations must respond to leads or customer issues within 60 seconds or they risk losing customers. It also delays the ability to activate personalized customer experiences at the right time and on the right channel. Slow or broken data pipeline makes customers unhappy, costing you conversions, satisfaction and trust.

**2. Data Loss & Inefficiency -** Constantly moving data between platforms not only leads to loss and inconsistency but also drains engineering time on integration work instead of driving impact.

**3. Slower Insights-** Fragmented system without unified data management leads to slow data processing, resulting in missed opportunities and delayed business decision.

**4. Revenue Leakage-** According to McKinsey, up to 40% of enterprise tech spend is wasted on unused licenses and redundant tools. These resources could be redirected toward innovation and growth.

It is high time to rethink how we handle data and build a customer centric data platform that talks to each other.

Datablit unlocks various opportunities to save time and cost and provide better ROI -

**1. Deliver Rich Customer Experience with Real-Time + Batch Data in One Place**

Customer behavior happens in real time. A user opens your app, clicks a product, joins a membership program, hits a threshold limit or abandons a cart. These actions are customer events. Signals are metrics that you continuously track to turn customer events into something meaningful. Add business rules for decision and get results in real-time or after a defined set interval batch data processing. Respond or take action instantly while also benefiting from the richness of long-term customer history.

**2. Drive Action or Respond to Customer Across all Your Channels**

Your data shouldn’t wait, it should drive action and respond within seconds. You can create rules and signals within seconds to instantly decide what action to take. Whether it's personalising a web page, triggering a button, offering certain discounts or routing customers to the right agent. Datablit lets you activate customer data and makes automatic decisions on your behalf to trigger action.

**3. Collaborate Business & Engineering Team for Fast Action & Better ROI**

Business teams should not rely on engineering for data to analyse, use actionable SQL to quickly analyse data for faster decision-making, without relying on data teams. Discuss and share ideas across teams ensuring better productivity for both technical and nontechnical departments by reducing reliance on data teams, enabling self-serve data access.
